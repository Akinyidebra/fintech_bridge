# FinTech Bridge

## Project Overview

FinTech Bridge is a mobile application designed to connect Kabarak University students with short-term loan providers. The application serves as an intermediary platform that addresses the urgent financial needs of university students who often face delays with traditional financial aid systems like HELB (Higher Education Loans Board). 

Based on research indicating that 75% of students at Kenyan universities experience delays in financial aid, this application aims to alleviate financial stress, improve academic performance, and enhance overall student well-being by providing quick access to short-term loans.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: University credential-based login system
- **Loan Application**: Streamlined application process for short-term loans
- **Pre-Assessment**: Automated risk assessment using alternative data
- **Provider Matching**: Connects eligible students with partnered financial institutions
- **Disbursement**: Facilitates fund transfers to student accounts
- **Repayment Management**: Tracks repayments and sends reminders
- **Real-time Notifications**: Updates on loan status and repayment schedules

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Flutter (Cross-platform mobile development)
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Database, Cloud Functions)
- **APIs**: Mobile Money Integration (M-Pesa), SMS Gateway
- **Analytics**: Firebase Analytics
